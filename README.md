# Medical Texts Classification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying Arabic medical texts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary objective is to accurately classify texts by leveraging various machine learning algorithms and text preprocessing methods.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Analysis and Understanding**
   - Analyze and comprehend the data without manually reading all entries.
   
2. **Text Cleaning and Standardization**
   - Clean and standardize the Arabic text to prepare it for classification.

3. **Text Classification**
   - Use different vectorization methods (e.g., TF-IDF, Bag of Words) and machine learning algorithms to classify the texts.
   - Study the impact of preprocessing techniques on classification accuracy.

4. **Experimentation with Libraries**
   - Work with libraries such as `sklearn`, `nltk`, and `pandas` for text processing and classification.

## Installation

To replicate this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the data and clean it using the provided preprocessing scripts.
   - Tokenize and vectorize the text data for model input.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Train various machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
   - Evaluate the models using validation and test datasets.

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - Analyze how different preprocessing steps affect the classification accuracy.

## Results

- The impact of preprocessing on classification accuracy was significant. Proper text cleaning and standardization improved model performance.
- The use of libraries like `nltk` and `sklearn` was critical in achieving accurate text classification.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the importance of text preprocessing in the context of NLP, particularly when handling complex languages like Arabic. The findings underscore the value of experimenting with different approaches to enhance model performance.
